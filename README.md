# ALIF SENSE - Hackathon Prototype

ALIF SENSE is a medical AI training and simulation platform designed to help healthcare professionals develop skills in working with AI systems, detecting biases, and navigating ethical considerations in AI-assisted medical decision making.

## Features

- **Medical Case Generator**: Generate medical cases using LangChain and AI
- **Diagnostic Reasoning**: Test AI diagnostic capabilities with symptom analysis
- **Medical Simulation**: Experience a medical case simulation with AI assistance
- **Bias Detection**: Learn to identify and mitigate biases in AI-assisted medical decision making

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)


## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- LangChain
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: React components
- `src/services`: Service layer including LangChain integration
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils`: Utility functions

## LangChain Integration

The application uses LangChain for:

1. Generating medical cases
2. Providing diagnostic reasoning
3. Simulating AI assistance in medical decision making



## Acknowledgments

- This project was created for demonstration purposes as a hackathon prototype.
- The medical cases and AI responses are simulated and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.
