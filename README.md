# ALIF SENSE - Hackathon Prototype

ALIF SENSE is a medical AI training and simulation platform designed to help healthcare professionals develop skills in working with AI systems, detecting biases, and navigating ethical considerations in AI-assisted medical decision making.

## Features

**Generate Medical Cases**
Create realistic medical cases with varying complexity using our advanced LangChain integration. Perfect for training and simulation.

**AI Diagnostic Reasoning**
Test AI diagnostic capabilities with symptom analysis and understand how AI models reason through complex medical cases.

**Medical Case Simulation**
Experience a complete medical case workflow with AI assistance. Practice diagnosing patients and compare your results with AI recommendations.

**Multi-Agent Collaboration**
Experience how multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to provide comprehensive medical analysis and recommendations.

**Medical Team Simulation**
Simulate a medical team with different AI agents representing various specialties collaborating on a case.

**Agentic AI Debate**
Experience autonomous AI reasoning as agents analyze evidence, form hypotheses, and optimize decisions through collaborative debate.

**Case Management**
Create, manage, and analyze multiple medical cases. Build your own library of cases for the Agentic AI Debate system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- LangChain
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: React components
- `src/services`: Service layer including LangChain integration
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils`: Utility functions

## LangChain Integration

The application uses LangChain for:

1. Generating medical cases
2. Providing diagnostic reasoning
3. Simulating AI assistance in medical decision making


## Acknowledgments

- This project was created for demonstration purposes as a hackathon prototype.
- The medical cases and AI responses are simulated and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.
